# Booktastic Server Go

Booktastic is a platform for distributed local libraries.  This is the fast API backend server; the frontend client
 is [here](https://github.com/tasticbooktastic/booktastic-nuxt3) and the PHP backend code is [here](https://github.com/tasticbooktastic/booktastic-server).

It was originally forked from [Iznik](https://github.com/freegle/booktastic-server-go), which is the platform used
